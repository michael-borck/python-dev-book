# Python Development Workflow Checklist

This checklist provides a practical reference for setting up and maintaining Python projects of different scales. Choose the practices that match your project's complexity and team size.

| Development Stage | Simple/Beginner Project | Intermediate/Large Project |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Project Setup** | | |
| Create project structure | ✅ Basic directory with code and tests | ✅ Full `src` layout with package under `src/` |
| Initialize version control | ✅ `git init` and basic `.gitignore` | ✅ Advanced `.gitignore` with branch strategies |
| Add essential files | ✅ README.md | ✅ README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md |
| | | |
| **Environment Setup** | | |
| Create virtual environment | ✅ `python -m venv .venv` | ✅ `uv venv` or containerized environment |
| Track dependencies | ✅ `pip freeze > requirements.txt` | ✅ `requirements.in` with `pip-compile` or `uv pip compile` |
| Install dependencies | ✅ `pip install -r requirements.txt` | ✅ `pip-sync` or `uv pip sync` |
| | | |
| **Code Quality** | | |
| Formatting | ✅ Basic PEP 8 adherence | ✅ Automated with Ruff (`ruff format`) |
| Linting | ❌ or basic Flake8 | ✅ Ruff with multiple rule sets enabled |
| Type checking | ❌ or basic annotations | ✅ mypy with increasing strictness |
| Security scanning | ❌ | ✅ Bandit |
| Dead code detection | ❌ | ✅ Vulture |
| | | |
| **Testing** | | |
| Unit tests | ✅ Basic pytest | ✅ Comprehensive pytest with fixtures |
| Test coverage | ❌ or basic | ✅ pytest-cov with coverage targets |
| Mocking | ❌ | ✅ pytest-mock for external dependencies |
| Integration tests | ❌ | ✅ For component interactions |
| Functional tests | ❌ | ✅ For key user workflows |
| | | |
| **Documentation** | | |
| Code documentation | ✅ Basic docstrings | ✅ Comprehensive docstrings (Google/NumPy style) |
| API documentation | ✅ Generated with pydoc | ✅ MkDocs + mkdocstrings |
| User guides | ✅ Basic README usage examples | ✅ Comprehensive MkDocs site with tutorials |
| | | |
| **Version Control Practices** | | |
| Commit frequency | ✅ Regular commits | ✅ Atomic, focused commits |
| Commit messages | ✅ Basic descriptive messages | ✅ Structured commit messages with context |
| Branching | ❌ or basic feature branches | ✅ Git-flow or trunk-based with feature branches |
| Code reviews | ❌ | ✅ Pull/Merge requests with review guidelines |
| | | |
| **Automation** | | |
| Local automation | ❌ | ✅ pre-commit hooks |
| CI pipeline | ❌ or basic | ✅ GitHub Actions with matrix testing |
| CD pipeline | ❌ | ✅ Automated deployments/releases |
| | | |
| **Packaging & Distribution** | | |
| Package configuration | ✅ Basic `pyproject.toml` | ✅ Comprehensive configuration with extras |
| Build system | ✅ Basic setuptools | ✅ Modern build with PEP 517 support |
| Release process | ✅ Manual versioning | ✅ Semantic versioning with automation |
| Publication | ❌ or manual PyPI upload | ✅ Automated PyPI deployment via CI |
| | | |
| **Maintenance** | | |
| Dependency updates | ✅ Manual updates | ✅ Scheduled updates with dependabot |
| Security monitoring | ❌ | ✅ Vulnerability scanning |
| Performance profiling | ❌ | ✅ Regular profiling and benchmarking |
| User feedback channels | ❌ | ✅ Issue templates and contribution guidelines |

## Project Progression Path

For projects that start simple but grow in complexity, follow this progression:

1. **Start with the essentials**:
   - Project structure and version control
   - Virtual environment
   - Basic testing
   - Clear README

2. **Add code quality tools incrementally**:
   - First add Ruff for formatting and basic linting
   - Then add mypy for critical modules
   - Finally add security scanning

3. **Enhance testing as complexity increases**:
   - Add coverage reporting
   - Implement mocking for external dependencies
   - Add integration tests for component interactions

4. **Improve documentation with growth**:
   - Start with good docstrings from day one
   - Transition to MkDocs when README becomes insufficient
   - Generate API documentation from docstrings

5. **Automate processes as repetition increases**:
   - Add pre-commit hooks for local checks
   - Implement CI for testing across environments
   - Add CD when deployment becomes routine

Remember: Don't overengineer! Choose the practices that add value to your specific project and team. It's better to implement a few practices well than to poorly implement many.
