# Documentation and Deployment

## Documentation Options: From pydoc to MkDocs

Documentation is often neglected in software development, yet it's crucial for ensuring others (including your future self) can understand and use your code effectively. Python offers a spectrum of documentation options, from simple built-in tools to sophisticated documentation generators.

### Starting Simple with Docstrings

The foundation of Python documentation is the humble docstring - a string literal that appears as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method:

```python
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """Calculate the discounted price.

    Args:
        price: The original price
        discount_percent: The discount percentage (0-100)

    Returns:
        The price after discount

    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent is negative or greater than 100
    """
    if not 0 <= discount_percent <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100")

    discount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
    return price - discount
```

Docstrings become particularly useful when following a consistent format. Common conventions include:

- **Google style** (shown above)
- **NumPy style** (similar to Google style but with different section headers)
- **reStructuredText** (used by Sphinx)

### Viewing Documentation with pydoc

Python's built-in `pydoc` module provides a simple way to access documentation:

```bash
# View module documentation in the terminal
python -m pydoc my_package.module

# Start an HTTP server to browse documentation
python -m pydoc -b
```

You can also generate basic HTML documentation:

```bash
# Create HTML for a specific module
python -m pydoc -w my_package.module

# Create HTML for an entire package
mkdir -p docs/html
python -m pydoc -w my_package
mv my_package*.html docs/html/
```

While simple, this approach has limitations:
- Minimal styling
- No cross-linking between documents
- Limited navigation options

For beginner projects, however, it provides a fast way to make documentation available with zero dependencies.

### Simple Script for Basic Documentation Site

For slightly more organized documentation than plain pydoc, you can create a simple script that:
1. Generates pydoc HTML for all modules
2. Creates a basic index.html linking to them

Here's a minimal example script (`build_docs.py`):

```python
import os
import importlib
import pkgutil
import pydoc

def generate_docs(package_name, output_dir="docs/api"):
    """Generate HTML documentation for all modules in a package."""
    # Ensure output directory exists
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Import the package
    package = importlib.import_module(package_name)

    # Track all modules for index page
    modules = []

    # Walk through all modules in the package
    for _, modname, ispkg in pkgutil.walk_packages(package.__path__, package_name + '.'):
        try:
            # Generate HTML documentation
            html_path = os.path.join(output_dir, modname + '.html')
            with open(html_path, 'w') as f:
                pydoc_output = pydoc.HTMLDoc().document(importlib.import_module(modname))
                f.write(pydoc_output)

            modules.append((modname, os.path.basename(html_path)))
            print(f"Generated documentation for {modname}")
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"Error importing {modname}: {e}")

    # Create index.html
    index_path = os.path.join(output_dir, 'index.html')
    with open(index_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write("<html><head><title>API Documentation</title></head><body>\n")
        f.write("<h1>API Documentation</h1>\n<ul>\n")

        for modname, html_file in sorted(modules):
            f.write(f'<li><a href="{html_file}">{modname}</a></li>\n')

        f.write("</ul></body></html>")

    print(f"Index created at {index_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Change 'my_package' to your actual package name
    generate_docs('my_package')
```

This script generates slightly more organized documentation than raw pydoc but still leverages built-in tools.

### Moving to MkDocs for Comprehensive Documentation

When your project grows and needs more sophisticated documentation, MkDocs provides an excellent balance of simplicity and features. MkDocs generates a static site from Markdown files, making it easy to write and maintain documentation.

#### Getting Started with MkDocs

First, install MkDocs and a theme:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

Initialize a new documentation project:

```bash
mkdocs new .
```

This creates a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file and a `docs/` directory with an `index.md` file.

#### Basic Configuration

Edit `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
site_name: My Project
theme:
  name: material
  palette:
    primary: indigo
    accent: indigo
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - User Guide:
    - Installation: user-guide/installation.md
    - Getting Started: user-guide/getting-started.md
  - API Reference: api-reference.md
  - Contributing: contributing.md
```

#### Creating Documentation Content

MkDocs uses Markdown files for content. Create `docs/user-guide/installation.md`:

```markdown
# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip package manager

## Installation Steps

1. Install from PyPI:

   ```bash
   pip install my-package
   ```

2. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   python -c "import my_package; print(my_package.__version__)"
   ```
```

#### Testing Documentation Locally

Preview your documentation while writing:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This starts a development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000 that automatically refreshes when you update files.

#### Building and Deploying Documentation

Generate static HTML files:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This creates a `site/` directory with the HTML documentation site.

For GitHub projects, you can publish to GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

### Hosting Documentation with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages provides a simple, free hosting solution for your project documentation that integrates seamlessly with your GitHub repository.

#### Setting Up GitHub Pages

There are two main approaches to hosting documentation on GitHub Pages:

1. **Repository site**: Serves content from a dedicated branch (typically `gh-pages`)
2. **User/Organization site**: Serves content from a special repository named `username.github.io`

For most Python projects, the repository site approach works best:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings → Pages
3. Under "Source", select your branch (either `main` or `gh-pages`)
4. Choose the folder that contains your documentation (`/` or `/docs`)
5. Click Save

Your documentation will be published at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`.

#### Automating Documentation Deployment

MkDocs has built-in support for GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
# Build and deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This command:
1. Builds your documentation into the `site/` directory
2. Creates or updates the `gh-pages` branch
3. Pushes the built site to that branch
4. GitHub automatically serves the content

For a fully automated workflow, integrate this into your GitHub Actions CI pipeline:

```yaml
name: Deploy Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'docs/**'
      - 'mkdocs.yml'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]
      - name: Deploy documentation
        run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

This workflow automatically deploys your documentation whenever you push changes to documentation files on the main branch.

#### GitHub Pages with pydoc

Even if you're using the simpler pydoc approach, you can still host the generated HTML on GitHub Pages:

1. Create a `docs/` folder in your repository
2. Generate HTML documentation with pydoc:
   ```bash
   python -m pydoc -w src/my_package/*.py
   mv *.html docs/
   ```
3. Add a simple `docs/index.html` that links to your module documentation
4. Configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `docs/` folder of your main branch

#### Custom Domains

For more established projects, you can use your own domain:

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar
2. Add a `CNAME` file to your documentation with your domain name
3. Configure your DNS settings according to GitHub's instructions
4. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings

By hosting your documentation on GitHub Pages, you make it easily accessible to users and maintainable alongside your codebase. It's a natural extension of the Git-based workflow we've established.

#### Enhancing MkDocs

MkDocs supports numerous plugins and extensions:

- **Code highlighting**: Built-in support for syntax highlighting
- **Admonitions**: Create warning, note, and info boxes
- **Search**: Built-in search functionality
- **Table of contents**: Automatic generation of section navigation

Example of enhanced configuration:

```yaml
site_name: My Project
theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.instant
    - navigation.tracking
    - navigation.expand
    - navigation.indexes
    - content.code.annotate
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition
  - pymdownx.highlight
  - pymdownx.superfences
  - toc:
      permalink: true
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocstrings:
      handlers:
        python:
          selection:
            docstring_style: google
```

### Integrating API Documentation

MkDocs alone is great for manual documentation, but you can also integrate auto-generated API documentation:

#### Using mkdocstrings

Install mkdocstrings to include docstrings from your code:

```bash
pip install mkdocstrings[python]
```

Update `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocstrings:
      handlers:
        python:
          selection:
            docstring_style: google
```

Then in your `docs/api-reference.md`:

```markdown
# API Reference

## Module my_package.core

This module contains core functionality.

::: my_package.core
    options:
      show_source: false
```

This automatically generates documentation from docstrings in your `my_package.core` module.

### Documentation Best Practices

Regardless of which documentation tool you choose, follow these best practices:

1. **Start with a clear README**: Include installation, quick start, and basic examples
2. **Document as you code**: Write documentation alongside code, not as an afterthought
3. **Include examples**: Show how to use functions and classes with realistic examples
4. **Document edge cases and errors**: Explain what happens in exceptional situations
5. **Keep documentation close to code**: Use docstrings for API details
6. **Maintain a changelog**: Track major changes between versions
7. **Consider different audiences**: Write for both new users and experienced developers

### Choosing the Right Documentation Approach

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Docstrings only | For very small, personal projects |
| pydoc | For simple projects with minimal documentation needs |
| Custom pydoc script | Small to medium projects needing basic organization |
| MkDocs | Medium to large projects requiring structured, attractive documentation |
| Sphinx | Large, complex projects, especially with scientific or mathematical content |

For most applications, the journey often progresses from simple docstrings to MkDocs as the project grows. By starting with good docstrings from the beginning, you make each subsequent step easier.

In the next section, we'll explore how to automate your workflow with CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

## CI/CD Workflows with GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate the process of testing, building, and deploying your code, ensuring quality and consistency throughout the development lifecycle. GitHub Actions provides a powerful and flexible way to implement CI/CD workflows directly within your GitHub repository.

### Understanding CI/CD Basics

Before diving into implementation, let's understand what each component achieves:

- **Continuous Integration**: Automatically testing code changes when pushed to the repository
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploying code to testing, staging, or production environments

A robust CI/CD pipeline typically includes:

1. Running tests
2. Verifying code quality (formatting, linting)
3. Static analysis (type checking, security scanning)
4. Building documentation
5. Building and publishing packages or applications
6. Deploying to environments

### Setting Up GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows are defined using YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. Each workflow file defines a set of jobs and steps that execute in response to specified events.

Start by creating the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Basic Python CI Workflow

Let's create a file named `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        cache: pip

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

    - name: Check formatting with Ruff
      run: ruff format --check .

    - name: Lint with Ruff
      run: ruff check .

    - name: Type check with mypy
      run: mypy src/

    - name: Run security checks with Bandit
      run: bandit -r src/ -x tests/

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest --cov=src/ --cov-report=xml

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
        fail_ci_if_error: true
```

This workflow:

1. Triggers on pushes to `main` and on pull requests
2. Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment
3. Tests against multiple Python versions
4. Sets up caching to speed up dependency installation
5. Runs our full suite of quality checks and tests
6. Uploads coverage reports to Codecov (if you've set up this integration)

### Using Dependency Caching

To speed up your workflow, GitHub Actions provides caching capabilities:

```yaml
- name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    cache: pip  # Enable pip caching
```

For more specific control over caching:

```yaml
- name: Cache pip packages
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements*.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

### Adapting for Different Dependency Tools

If you're using uv instead of pip, adjust your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Install uv
  run: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

- name: Install dependencies with uv
  run: |
    uv pip sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
```

### Building and Publishing Documentation

Add a job to build documentation with MkDocs:

```yaml
docs:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]

    - name: Build documentation
      run: mkdocs build --strict

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./site
```

This job builds your documentation with MkDocs and deploys it to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Building and Publishing Python Packages

For projects that produce packages, add a job for publication to PyPI:

```yaml
publish:
  needs: [test, docs]  # Only run if test and docs jobs pass
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # Only publish on tagged releases
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"

    - name: Install build dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine

    - name: Build package
      run: python -m build

    - name: Check package with twine
      run: twine check dist/*

    - name: Publish package
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
        user: __token__
        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

This job:
1. Only runs after tests and documentation have passed
2. Only triggers on tagged commits (releases)
3. Builds the package using the `build` package
4. Validates the package with `twine`
5. Publishes to PyPI using a secure token

You would need to add the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` to your repository secrets.

### Running Tests in Multiple Environments

For applications that need to support multiple operating systems or Python versions:

```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
  strategy:
    matrix:
      os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
      python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]

  steps:
    # ... Steps as before ...
```

This configuration runs your tests on three operating systems with three Python versions each, for a total of nine environments.

### Branch Protection and Required Checks

To ensure code quality, set up branch protection rules on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository → Settings → Branches
2. Add a rule for your main branch
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Select the checks from your CI workflow

This prevents merging pull requests until all tests pass, maintaining your code quality standards.

### Scheduled Workflows

Run your tests on a schedule to catch issues with external dependencies:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sundays at midnight
```

### Notifications and Feedback

Configure notifications for workflow results:

```yaml
- name: Send notification
  if: always()
  uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
    SLACK_TITLE: CI Result
    SLACK_MESSAGE: ${{ job.status }}
    SLACK_COLOR: ${{ job.status == 'success' && 'good' || 'danger' }}
```

This example sends notifications to Slack, but similar actions exist for other platforms.

### A Complete CI/CD Workflow Example

Here's a comprehensive workflow example bringing together many of the concepts we've covered:

```yaml
name: Python CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sundays

jobs:
  quality:
    name: Code Quality
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
          cache: pip

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

      - name: Check formatting
        run: ruff format --check .

      - name: Lint with Ruff
        run: ruff check .

      - name: Type check
        run: mypy src/

      - name: Security scan
        run: bandit -r src/ -x tests/

      - name: Check for dead code
        run: vulture src/ --min-confidence 80

  test:
    name: Test
    needs: quality
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
        include:
          - os: windows-latest
            python-version: "3.10"
          - os: macos-latest
            python-version: "3.10"

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          cache: pip

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

      - name: Test with pytest
        run: pytest --cov=src/ --cov-report=xml

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml

  docs:
    name: Documentation
    needs: quality
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"

      - name: Install docs dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]

      - name: Build docs
        run: mkdocs build --strict

      - name: Deploy docs
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./site

  publish:
    name: Publish Package
    needs: [test, docs]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"

      - name: Install build dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install build twine

      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build

      - name: Check package
        run: twine check dist/*

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          user: __token__
          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: dist/*
          generate_release_notes: true
```

This comprehensive workflow:
1. Checks code quality (formatting, linting, type checking, security, dead code)
2. Runs tests on multiple Python versions and operating systems
3. Builds and deploys documentation
4. Publishes packages to PyPI on tagged releases
5. Creates GitHub releases with release notes

### CI/CD Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows modular**: Split complex workflows into logical jobs
2. **Fail fast**: Run quick checks (like formatting) before longer ones (like testing)
3. **Cache dependencies**: Speed up workflows by caching pip packages
4. **Be selective**: Only run necessary jobs based on changed files
5. **Test thoroughly**: Include all environments your code supports
6. **Secure secrets**: Use GitHub's secret storage for tokens and keys
7. **Monitor performance**: Watch workflow execution times and optimize slow steps

With these CI/CD practices in place, your development workflow becomes more reliable and automatic. Quality checks run on every change, documentation stays up to date, and releases happen smoothly and consistently.

In the final section, we'll explore how to publish and distribute Python packages to make your work available to others.

## Package Publishing and Distribution

When your Python project matures, you may want to share it with others through the Python Package Index (PyPI). Publishing your package makes it installable via `pip`, allowing others to easily use your work.

### Preparing Your Package for Distribution

Before publishing, your project needs the right structure. Let's ensure everything is ready:

#### 1. Package Structure Review

A distributable package should have this basic structure:

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   └── my_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── module1.py
│       └── module2.py
├── tests/

#### 2. Package Configuration with pyproject.toml

Modern Python packaging uses `pyproject.toml` for configuration:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "my-package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A short description of my package"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license = {text = "MIT"}
authors = [
    {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}
]
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.25.0",
    "numpy>=1.20.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "pytest-cov",
    "ruff",
    "mypy",
]
doc = [
    "mkdocs",
    "mkdocs-material",
    "mkdocstrings[python]",
]

[project.urls]
"Homepage" = "https://github.com/yourusername/my-package"
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/yourusername/my-package/issues"

[project.scripts]
my-command = "my_package.cli:main"

[tool.setuptools]
package-dir = {"" = "src"}
packages = ["my_package"]
```

This configuration:
- Defines basic metadata (name, version, description)
- Lists dependencies (both required and optional)
- Sets up entry points for command-line scripts
- Specifies the package location (src layout)

#### 3. Include Essential Files

Ensure you have these files:

```bash
# Create a LICENSE file (example: MIT License)
cat > LICENSE << EOF
MIT License

Copyright (c) $(date +%Y) Your Name

Permission is hereby granted...
EOF

# Create a comprehensive README.md with:
# - What the package does
# - Installation instructions
# - Basic usage examples
# - Links to documentation
# - Contributing guidelines
```

### Building Your Package

With configuration in place, you're ready to build distribution packages:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build

# Build both wheel and source distribution
python -m build
```

This creates two files in the `dist/` directory:
- A source distribution (`.tar.gz`)
- A wheel file (`.whl`)

Always check your distributions before publishing:

```bash
# Install twine
pip install twine

# Check the package
twine check dist/*
```

### Publishing to Test PyPI

Before publishing to the real PyPI, test your package on TestPyPI:

1. Create a TestPyPI account at https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
2. Upload your package:

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

3. Test installation from TestPyPI:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ my-package
```

### Publishing to PyPI

When everything works correctly on TestPyPI:

1. Create a PyPI account at https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. Upload your package:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

Your package is now available to the world via `pip install my-package`!

### Automating Package Publishing

To automate publishing with GitHub Actions, add a workflow that:
1. Builds the package
2. Uploads to PyPI when you create a release tag

```yaml
name: Publish Python Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine
    - name: Build and publish
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
      run: |
        python -m build
        twine upload dist/*
```

For better security, use API tokens instead of your PyPI password:
1. Generate a token from your PyPI account settings
2. Add it as a GitHub repository secret
3. Use the token in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build and publish
  env:
    TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
    TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    python -m build
    twine upload dist/*
```

### Versioning Best Practices

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
- MINOR: New functionality (backward-compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

Track versions in one place, usually in `__init__.py`:

```python
# src/my_package/__init__.py
__version__ = "0.1.0"
```

Or with a dynamic version from your git tags using setuptools-scm:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel", "setuptools_scm[toml]>=6.2"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[tool.setuptools_scm]
# Uses git tags for versioning
```

### Creating Releases

A good release process includes:

1. **Update documentation**:
   - Ensure README is current
   - Update changelog with notable changes

2. **Create a new version**:
   - Update version number
   - Create a git tag:
     ```bash
     git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0"
     git push origin v0.1.0
     ```

3. **Monitor the CI/CD pipeline**:
   - Ensure tests pass
   - Verify package build succeeds
   - Confirm successful publication

4. **Announce the release**:
   - Create GitHub release notes
   - Post in relevant community forums
   - Update documentation site

### Package Maintenance

Once published, maintain your package responsibly:

1. **Monitor issues** on GitHub or GitLab
2. **Respond to bug reports** promptly
3. **Review and accept contributions** from the community
4. **Regularly update dependencies** to address security issues
5. **Create new releases** when significant improvements are ready

### Advanced Distribution Topics

As your package ecosystem grows, consider these advanced techniques:

#### 1. Binary Extensions

For performance-critical components, you might include compiled C extensions:
- Use [Cython](https://cython.org/) to compile Python to C
- Configure with the `build-system` section in pyproject.toml
- Build platform-specific wheels

#### 2. Namespace Packages

For large projects split across multiple packages:

```python
# src/myorg/packageone/__init__.py
# src/myorg/packagetwo/__init__.py

# Makes 'myorg' a namespace package
```

#### 3. Conditional Dependencies

For platform-specific dependencies:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.25.0",
    "numpy>=1.20.0",
    "pywin32>=300; platform_system == 'Windows'",
]
```

#### 4. Data Files

Include non-Python files (data, templates, etc.):

```toml
[tool.setuptools]
package-dir = {"" = "src"}
packages = ["my_package"]
include-package-data = true
```

Create a `MANIFEST.in` file:
```
include src/my_package/data/*.json
include src/my_package/templates/*.html
```

By following these practices, you'll create a professional, well-maintained package that others can easily discover, install, and use. Publishing your work to PyPI is not just about sharing code—it's about participating in the Python ecosystem and contributing back to the community.


### Modern vs. Traditional Python Packaging

Python packaging has evolved significantly over the years:

#### Traditional `setup.py` Approach

Historically, Python packages required a `setup.py` file:

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my-package",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "requests>=2.25.0",
        "numpy>=1.20.0",
    ],
)
```

This approach is still common and has advantages for:
- Compatibility with older tooling
- Dynamic build processes that need Python code
- Complex build requirements (e.g., C extensions, custom steps)

#### Modern `pyproject.toml` Approach

Since PEP 517/518, packages can use `pyproject.toml` exclusively:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "my-package"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.25.0",
    "numpy>=1.20.0",
]
```

This declarative approach is recommended for new projects because it:
- Provides a standardized configuration format
- Supports multiple build systems (not just setuptools)
- Simplifies dependency specification
- Avoids executing Python code during installation

#### Which Approach Should You Use?

- For new, straightforward packages: Use `pyproject.toml` only
- For packages with complex build requirements: You may need both `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`
- For maintaining existing packages: Consider gradually migrating to `pyproject.toml`

Many projects use a hybrid approach, with basic metadata in `pyproject.toml` and complex build logic in `setup.py`.
