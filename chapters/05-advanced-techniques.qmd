# Advanced Development Techniques

This section could focus on taking Python development to the next level beyond the fundamentals covered in earlier parts:

1. **Containerization with Docker**
   - Creating development containers
   - Multi-stage builds for Python applications
   - Docker Compose for development environments
   - Production containers and security considerations

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profiling tools and techniques
   - Memory usage analysis and optimization
   - CPU bottleneck identification
   - Just-in-time compilation with Numba
   - Cython for performance-critical code

3. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Managing path differences between operating systems
   - Platform-specific code and dependencies
   - Building standalone applications with PyInstaller
   - Platform-specific packaging considerations

4. **Database Integration Best Practices**
   - ORM patterns with SQLAlchemy
   - Connection management and pooling
   - Migration strategies
   - Testing with database fixtures

5. **API Development and Integration**
   - RESTful API design in Python
   - AsyncIO for high-performance services
   - OpenAPI/Swagger integration
   - API testing strategies
