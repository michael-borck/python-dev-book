## Robust Dependency Management with pip-tools and uv

As your projects grow in complexity or involve more developers, the basic `pip freeze > requirements.txt` approach starts to show limitations. You need a dependency management system that gives you more control and ensures truly reproducible environments.

### The Problem with `pip freeze`

While `pip freeze` is convenient, it has several drawbacks:

1. **No distinction between direct and indirect dependencies**: You can't easily tell which packages you explicitly need versus those that were installed as dependencies of other packages.

2. **Maintenance challenges**: When you want to update a package, you may need to regenerate the entire requirements file, potentially changing packages you didn't intend to update.

3. **No environment synchronization**: Installing from a requirements.txt file adds packages but doesn't remove packages that are no longer needed.

4. **No explicit dependency specification**: You can't easily specify version ranges (e.g., "I need any Django 4.x version") or extras.

Let's explore two powerful solutions: `pip-tools` and `uv`.

### Solution 1: pip-tools

pip-tools introduces a two-file approach to dependency management:

1. `requirements.in`: A manually maintained list of your direct dependencies, potentially with version constraints.
2. `requirements.txt`: A generated lock file containing exact versions of all dependencies (direct and indirect).

#### Getting Started with pip-tools

```bash
# Install pip-tools in your virtual environment
pip install pip-tools

# Create a requirements.in file with your direct dependencies
cat > requirements.in << EOF
requests>=2.25.0  # Use any version 2.25.0 or newer
flask==2.0.1      # Use exactly this version
pandas            # Use any version
EOF

# Compile the lock file
pip-compile requirements.in

# Install the exact dependencies
pip-sync requirements.txt
```

The generated `requirements.txt` will contain exact versions of your specified packages plus all their dependencies, including hashes for security.

#### Managing Development Dependencies

For a cleaner setup, you can separate production and development dependencies:

```bash
# Create requirements-dev.in
cat > requirements-dev.in << EOF
-c requirements.txt  # Constraint: use same versions as in requirements.txt
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov
ruff
mypy
EOF

# Compile development dependencies
pip-compile requirements-dev.in -o requirements-dev.txt

# Install all dependencies (both prod and dev)
pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
```

#### Updating Dependencies

When you need to update packages:

```bash
# Update all packages to their latest allowed versions
pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in

# Update a specific package
pip-compile --upgrade-package requests requirements.in

# After updating, sync your environment
pip-sync requirements.txt
```

### Solution 2: uv

`uv` is a newer, Rust-based tool that provides significant speed improvements while maintaining compatibility with existing Python packaging standards. It combines environment management, package installation, and dependency resolution in one tool.

#### Getting Started with uv

```bash
# Install uv (globally with pipx or in your current environment)
pipx install uv
# Or: pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment (if needed)
uv venv

# Activate the environment as usual
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Create the same requirements.in file as above
cat > requirements.in << EOF
requests>=2.25.0
flask==2.0.1
pandas
EOF

# Compile the lock file
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt

# Install dependencies
uv pip sync requirements.txt
```

#### Key Advantages of uv

1. **Speed**: uv is significantly faster than standard pip and pip-tools, especially for large dependency trees.

2. **Global caching**: uv implements efficient caching, reducing redundant downloads across projects.

3. **Consolidated tooling**: Acts as a replacement for multiple tools (pip, pip-tools, virtualenv) with a consistent interface.

4. **Enhanced dependency resolution**: Often provides clearer error messages for dependency conflicts.

#### Managing Dependencies with uv

uv supports the same workflow as pip-tools but with different commands:

```bash
# For development dependencies
cat > requirements-dev.in << EOF
-c requirements.txt
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov
ruff
mypy
EOF

# Compile dev dependencies
uv pip compile requirements-dev.in -o requirements-dev.txt

# Install all dependencies
uv pip sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt

# Update a specific package
uv pip compile --upgrade-package requests requirements.in
```

### Choosing Between pip-tools and uv

Both tools solve the core problem of creating reproducible environments, but with different tradeoffs:

| Factor | pip-tools | uv |
|--------|-----------|---|
| Speed | Good | Excellent (often 10x+ faster) |
| Installation | Simple Python package | External tool (but simple to install) |
| Maturity | Well-established | Newer but rapidly maturing |
| Functionality | Focused on dependency locking | Broader tool combining multiple functions |
| Learning curve | Minimal | Minimal (designed for compatibility) |

For beginners or smaller projects, pip-tools offers a gentle introduction to proper dependency management with minimal new concepts. For larger projects or when speed becomes important, uv provides significant benefits with a similar workflow.

### Best Practices for Either Approach

Regardless of which tool you choose:

1. **Commit both `.in` and `.txt` files** to version control. The `.in` files represent your intent, while the `.txt` files ensure reproducibility.

2. **Use constraints carefully**. Start with loose constraints (just package names) and add version constraints only when needed.

3. **Regularly update dependencies** to get security fixes, using `--upgrade` or `--upgrade-package`.

4. **Always use `pip-sync` or `uv pip sync`** instead of `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure your environment exactly matches the lock file.

In the next section, we'll explore how to maintain code quality through automated formatting and linting with Ruff, taking your workflow to the next professional level.

## Code Quality Tools with Ruff

Writing code that works is only part of the development process. Code should also be readable, maintainable, and free from common errors. This is where code quality tools come in, helping you enforce consistent style and catch potential issues early.

### The Evolution of Python Code Quality Tools

Traditionally, Python developers used multiple specialized tools:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **Flake8** for linting (style checks)
- **Pylint** for deeper static analysis

While effective, maintaining configuration for all these tools was cumbersome. Enter Ruff – a modern, Rust-based tool that combines formatting and linting in one incredibly fast package.

### Why Ruff?

Ruff offers several compelling advantages:

1. **Speed**: Often 10-100x faster than traditional Python linters
2. **Consolidation**: Replaces multiple tools with one consistent interface
3. **Compatibility**: Implements rules from established tools (Flake8, Black, isort, etc.)
4. **Configuration**: Single configuration in your pyproject.toml file
5. **Automatic fixing**: Can automatically fix many issues it identifies

### Getting Started with Ruff

First, install Ruff in your virtual environment:

```bash
# If using pip
pip install ruff

# If using uv
uv pip install ruff
```

### Basic Configuration

Configure Ruff in your `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Enable pycodestyle, Pyflakes, isort, and more
select = ["E", "F", "I"]
ignore = []

# Allow lines to be as long as 100 characters
line-length = 100

# Assume Python 3.10
target-version = "py310"

[tool.ruff.format]
# Formats code similar to Black (this is the default)
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
line-ending = "auto"
```

This configuration enables:
- `E` rules from pycodestyle (PEP 8 style guide)
- `F` rules from Pyflakes (logical and syntax error detection)
- `I` rules for import sorting (like isort)

### Using Ruff in Your Workflow

Ruff provides two main commands:

```bash
# Check code for issues without changing it
ruff check .

# Format code (similar to Black)
ruff format .
```

To automatically fix issues that Ruff can solve:

```bash
# Fix all auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix .
```

### Real-world Configuration Example

Here's a more comprehensive configuration that balances strictness with practicality:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Target Python version
target-version = "py39"
# Line length
line-length = 88

# Enable a comprehensive set of rules
select = [
    "E",   # pycodestyle errors
    "F",   # pyflakes
    "I",   # isort
    "W",   # pycodestyle warnings
    "C90", # mccabe complexity
    "N",   # pep8-naming
    "B",   # flake8-bugbear
    "UP",  # pyupgrade
    "D",   # pydocstyle
]

# Ignore specific rules
ignore = [
    "E203",  # Whitespace before ':' (handled by formatter)
    "D100",  # Missing docstring in public module
    "D104",  # Missing docstring in public package
]

# Exclude certain files/directories from checking
exclude = [
    ".git",
    ".venv",
    "__pycache__",
    "build",
    "dist",
]

[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]
# Use Google-style docstrings
convention = "google"

[tool.ruff.mccabe]
# Maximum McCabe complexity allowed
max-complexity = 10

[tool.ruff.format]
# Formatting options (black-compatible by default)
quote-style = "double"
```

### Integrating Ruff into Your Editor

Ruff provides editor integrations for:

- VS Code (via the Ruff extension)
- PyCharm (via third-party plugin)
- Vim/Neovim
- Emacs

For example, in VS Code, install the Ruff extension and add to your settings.json:

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.ruff": true,
        "source.organizeImports.ruff": true
    }
}
```

This configuration automatically formats code and fixes issues whenever you save a file.

### Gradually Adopting Ruff

If you're working with an existing codebase, you can adopt Ruff gradually:

1. **Start with formatting only**: Begin with `ruff format` to establish consistent formatting
2. **Add basic linting**: Enable a few rule sets like `E`, `F`, and `I`
3. **Gradually increase strictness**: Add more rule sets as your team adjusts
4. **Use per-file ignores**: For specific issues in specific files

```toml
[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
"tests/*" = ["D103"]  # Ignore missing docstrings in tests
"__init__.py" = ["F401"]  # Ignore unused imports in __init__.py
```

### Enforcing Code Quality in CI

Add Ruff to your CI pipeline to ensure code quality standards are maintained:

```yaml
# In your GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- name: Check formatting with Ruff
  run: ruff format --check .
  
- name: Lint with Ruff
  run: ruff check .
```

The `--check` flag on `ruff format` makes it exit with an error if files would be reformatted, instead of actually changing them.

### Beyond Ruff: When to Consider Other Tools

While Ruff covers a wide range of code quality checks, some specific needs might require additional tools:

- **mypy** for static type checking (covered in a later section)
- **bandit** for security-focused checks
- **vulture** for finding dead code

However, Ruff's rule set continues to expand, potentially reducing the need for these additional tools over time.

By incorporating Ruff into your workflow, you'll catch many common errors before they reach production and maintain a consistent, readable codebase. In the next section, we'll explore how to ensure your code works as expected through automated testing with pytest.

## Automated Testing with pytest

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures your code works as intended and continues to work as you make changes. Python's testing ecosystem offers numerous frameworks, but pytest has emerged as the most popular and powerful choice for most projects.

### Why Testing Matters

Automated tests provide several key benefits:

1. **Verification**: Confirm that your code works as expected
2. **Regression prevention**: Catch when changes break existing functionality
3. **Documentation**: Tests demonstrate how code is meant to be used
4. **Refactoring confidence**: Change code structure while ensuring behavior remains correct
5. **Design feedback**: Difficult-to-test code often indicates design problems

### Getting Started with pytest

First, install pytest in your virtual environment:

```bash
# Standard installation
pip install pytest

# With coverage reporting
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

### Writing Your First Test

Let's assume you have a simple function in `src/my_package/calculations.py`:

```python
def add(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return a + b
```

Create a test file in `tests/test_calculations.py`:

```python
from my_package.calculations import add

def test_add():
    # Test basic addition
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2
    
    # Test with floating point
    assert add(1.5, 2.5) == 4.0
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests from your project root:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with more detail
pytest -v

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_calculations.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/test_calculations.py::test_add
```

### pytest Features That Make Testing Easier

pytest has several features that make it superior to Python's built-in unittest framework:

#### 1. Simple Assertions

Instead of methods like `assertEqual` or `assertTrue`, pytest lets you use Python's built-in `assert` statement, making tests more readable.

```python
# With pytest
assert result == expected

# Instead of unittest's
self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

#### 2. Fixtures

Fixtures are a powerful way to set up preconditions for your tests:

```python
import pytest
from my_package.database import Database

@pytest.fixture
def db():
    """Provide a clean database instance for tests."""
    db = Database(":memory:")  # Use in-memory SQLite
    db.create_tables()
    yield db
    db.close()  # Cleanup happens after the test

def test_save_record(db):
    # The db fixture is automatically provided
    record = {"id": 1, "name": "Test"}
    db.save(record)
    assert db.get(1) == record
```

#### 3. Parameterized Tests

Test multiple inputs without repetitive code:

```python
import pytest
from my_package.calculations import add

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a, b, expected", [
    (1, 2, 3),
    (-1, 1, 0),
    (0, 0, 0),
    (1.5, 2.5, 4.0),
])
def test_add_parametrized(a, b, expected):
    assert add(a, b) == expected
```

#### 4. Marks for Test Organization

Organize tests with marks:

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_complex_calculation():
    # This test takes a long time
    ...

# Run only tests marked as 'slow'
# pytest -m slow

@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Feature not implemented yet")
def test_future_feature():
    ...

@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Known bug #123")
def test_buggy_function():
    ...
```

### Test Coverage

Track which parts of your code are tested using pytest-cov:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=src/my_package

# Generate HTML report for detailed analysis
pytest --cov=src/my_package --cov-report=html
# Then open htmlcov/index.html in your browser
```

A coverage report helps identify untested code:

```
----------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.9.5-final-0 -----------
Name                             Stmts   Miss  Cover
----------------------------------------------------
src/my_package/__init__.py           1      0   100%
src/my_package/calculations.py      10      2    80%
src/my_package/models.py            45     15    67%
----------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                               56     17    70%
```

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Write tests as you develop**: Don't wait until the end
2. **Name tests clearly**: Include the function name and scenario being tested
3. **One assertion per test**: Focus each test on a single behavior
4. **Test edge cases**: Empty input, boundary values, error conditions
5. **Avoid test interdependence**: Tests should work independently
6. **Mock external dependencies**: APIs, databases, file systems
7. **Keep tests fast**: Slow tests get run less often

### Common Testing Patterns

#### Testing Exceptions

Verify that your code raises the right exceptions:

```python
import pytest
from my_package.validate import validate_username

def test_validate_username_too_short():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        validate_username("ab")  # Too short
    assert "Username must be at least 3 characters" in str(excinfo.value)
```

#### Testing with Temporary Files

Test file operations safely:

```python
def test_save_to_file(tmp_path):
    # tmp_path is a built-in pytest fixture
    file_path = tmp_path / "test.txt"
    
    # Test file writing
    save_to_file(file_path, "test content")
    
    # Verify content
    assert file_path.read_text() == "test content"
```

#### Mocking

Isolate your code from external dependencies using the pytest-mock plugin:

```python
def test_fetch_user_data(mocker):
    # Mock the API call
    mock_response = mocker.patch('requests.get')
    mock_response.return_value.json.return_value = {"id": 1, "name": "Test User"}
    
    # Test our function
    from my_package.api import get_user
    user = get_user(1)
    
    # Verify results
    assert user['name'] == "Test User"
    mock_response.assert_called_once_with('https://api.example.com/users/1')
```

### Testing Strategy

As your project grows, organize tests into different categories:

1. **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
2. **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **Functional tests**: Test entire features from a user perspective

Most projects should have a pyramid shape: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and even fewer functional tests.

### Continuous Testing

Make testing a habitual part of your workflow:

1. **Run relevant tests as you code**: Many editors integrate with pytest
2. **Run full test suite before committing**: Use pre-commit hooks
3. **Run tests in CI**: Catch issues that might only appear in different environments

By incorporating comprehensive testing into your development process, you'll catch bugs earlier, ship with more confidence, and build a more maintainable codebase.

In the next section, we'll explore static type checking with mypy, which can help catch a whole new category of errors before your code even runs.

## Type Checking with mypy

Python is dynamically typed, which provides flexibility but can also lead to type-related errors that only appear at runtime. Static type checking with mypy adds an extra layer of verification, catching many potential issues before your code executes.

### Understanding Type Hints

Python 3.5+ supports type hints, which are annotations indicating what types of values functions expect and return:

```python
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

These annotations don't change how Python runs—they're ignored by the interpreter at runtime. However, tools like mypy can analyze them statically to catch potential type errors.

### Getting Started with mypy

First, install mypy in your development environment:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

Let's check a simple example:

```python
# example.py
def double(x: int) -> int:
    return x * 2

# This is fine
result = double(5)

# This would fail at runtime
double("hello")
```

Run mypy to check:

```bash
mypy example.py
```

Output:
```
example.py:8: error: Argument 1 to "double" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
```

mypy caught the type mismatch without running the code!

### Configuring mypy

Configure mypy in your `pyproject.toml` file for a consistent experience:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = false
disallow_incomplete_defs = false
```

Start with a lenient configuration and gradually increase strictness:

```toml
# Starting configuration: permissive but helpful
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
warn_return_any = true
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = false

# Intermediate configuration: more rigorous
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
warn_return_any = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = false
check_untyped_defs = true

# Strict configuration: full typing required
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unreachable = true
```

### Gradual Typing

One major advantage of Python's type system is gradual typing—you can add types incrementally:

1. Start with critical or error-prone modules
2. Add types to public interfaces first
3. Increase type coverage over time

### Essential Type Annotations

#### Basic Types

```python
# Variables
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
height: float = 1.75
is_active: bool = True

# Lists, sets, and dictionaries
names: list[str] = ["Alice", "Bob"]
unique_ids: set[int] = {1, 2, 3}
user_scores: dict[str, int] = {"Alice": 100, "Bob": 85}
```

#### Function Annotations

```python
def calculate_total(prices: list[float], tax_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """Calculate the total price including tax."""
    subtotal = sum(prices)
    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
```

#### Class Annotations

```python
from typing import Optional

class User:
    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str, age: Optional[int] = None):
        self.name: str = name
        self.email: str = email
        self.age: Optional[int] = age
    
    def is_adult(self) -> bool:
        """Check if user is an adult."""
        return self.age is not None and self.age >= 18
```

### Advanced Type Hints

#### Union Types

Use Union to indicate multiple possible types (use the `|` operator in Python 3.10+):

```python
from typing import Union

# Python 3.9 and earlier
def process_input(data: Union[str, list[str]]) -> str:
    if isinstance(data, list):
        return ", ".join(data)
    return data

# Python 3.10+
def process_input(data: str | list[str]) -> str:
    if isinstance(data, list):
        return ", ".join(data)
    return data
```

#### Optional and None

`Optional[T]` is equivalent to `Union[T, None]` or `T | None`:

```python
from typing import Optional

def find_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Return user data or None if not found."""
    # Implementation...
```

#### Type Aliases

Create aliases for complex types:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

# Complex type
TransactionRecord = Tuple[str, float, str, Dict[str, str]]

# More readable with alias
def process_transactions(transactions: List[TransactionRecord]) -> float:
    total = 0.0
    for _, amount, _, _ in transactions:
        total += amount
    return total
```

#### Callable

Type hint for functions:

```python
from typing import Callable

def apply_function(func: Callable[[int], str], value: int) -> str:
    """Apply a function that converts int to str."""
    return func(value)
```

### Common Challenges and Solutions

#### Working with Third-Party Libraries

Not all libraries provide type hints. For popular packages, you can often find stub files:

```bash
pip install types-requests
```

For others, you can silence mypy warnings selectively:

```python
import untyped_library  # type: ignore
```

#### Dealing with Dynamic Features

Python's dynamic features can be challenging to type. Use `Any` when necessary:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict

def parse_config(config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Parse configuration with unknown structure."""
    # Implementation...
```

### Integration with Your Workflow

#### Running mypy

```bash
# Check a specific file
mypy src/my_package/module.py

# Check the entire package
mypy src/my_package/

# Use multiple processes for faster checking
mypy -p my_package --python-version 3.9 --multiprocessing
```

#### Integrating with CI/CD

Add mypy to your continuous integration workflow:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Type check with mypy
  run: mypy src/
```

#### Editor Integration

Most Python-friendly editors support mypy:

- VS Code: Use the Pylance extension
- PyCharm: Has built-in type checking
- vim/neovim: Use ALE or similar plugins

### Benefits of Type Checking

1. **Catch errors early**: Find type-related bugs before running code
2. **Improved IDE experience**: Better code completion and refactoring
3. **Self-documenting code**: Types serve as documentation
4. **Safer refactoring**: Change code with more confidence
5. **Gradual adoption**: Add types where they provide the most value

### When to Use Type Hints

Type hints are particularly valuable for:

- Functions with complex parameters or return values
- Public APIs used by others
- Areas with frequent bugs
- Critical code paths
- Large codebases with multiple contributors

Type checking isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. Even partial type coverage can significantly improve code quality and catch common errors. Start small, focus on interfaces, and expand your type coverage as your team becomes comfortable with the system.

## Security Analysis with Bandit

Software security is a critical concern in modern development, yet it's often overlooked until problems arise. Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code through static analysis.

### Understanding Security Static Analysis

Unlike functional testing or linting, security-focused static analysis looks specifically for patterns and practices that could lead to security vulnerabilities:

- Injection vulnerabilities
- Use of insecure functions
- Hardcoded credentials
- Insecure cryptography
- And many other security issues

### Getting Started with Bandit

First, install Bandit in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install bandit
```

Run a basic scan:

```bash
# Scan a specific file
bandit -r src/my_package/main.py

# Scan your entire codebase
bandit -r src/
```

### Security Issues Bandit Can Detect

Bandit identifies a wide range of security concerns, including:

#### 1. Hardcoded Secrets

```python
# Bandit will flag this
def connect_to_database():
    password = "super_secret_password"  # Hardcoded secret
    return Database("user", password)
```

#### 2. SQL Injection

```python
# Vulnerable to SQL injection
def get_user(username):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
    return db.execute(query)

# Safer approach
def get_user_safe(username):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
    return db.execute(query, (username,))
```

#### 3. Shell Injection

```python
# Vulnerable to command injection
def run_command(user_input):
    return os.system(f"ls {user_input}")  # User could inject commands

# Safer approach
import subprocess
def run_command_safe(user_input):
    return subprocess.run(["ls", user_input], capture_output=True, text=True)
```

#### 4. Insecure Cryptography

```python
# Using weak hash algorithms
import hashlib
def hash_password(password):
    return hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()  # MD5 is insecure
```

#### 5. Unsafe Deserialization

```python
# Insecure deserialization
import pickle
def load_user_preferences(data):
    return pickle.loads(data)  # Pickle can execute arbitrary code
```

### Configuring Bandit

You can configure Bandit using a `.bandit` file or your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.bandit]
exclude_dirs = ["tests", "docs"]
skips = ["B311"]  # Skip random warning
targets = ["src"]
```

The most critical findings are categorized with high severity and confidence levels:

```bash
# Only report high-severity issues
bandit -r src/ -iii -ll
```

### Integrating Bandit in Your Workflow

#### Add Bandit to CI/CD

Add security scanning to your continuous integration pipeline:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Security check with Bandit
  run: bandit -r src/ -f json -o bandit-results.json

# Optional: convert results to GitHub Security format
# (requires additional tools or post-processing)
```

#### Pre-commit Hook

Configure a pre-commit hook to run Bandit before commits:

```yaml
# In .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
  rev: 1.7.5
  hooks:
    - id: bandit
      args: ["-r", "src"]
```

### Responding to Security Findings

When Bandit identifies security issues:

1. **Understand the risk**: Read the detailed explanation to understand the potential vulnerability
2. **Fix high-severity issues immediately**: These represent significant security risks
3. **Document deliberate exceptions**: If a finding is a false positive, document why and use an inline ignore comment
4. **Review regularly**: Security standards evolve, so regular scanning is essential

### False Positives

Like any static analysis tool, Bandit can produce false positives. You can exclude specific findings:

```python
# In code, to ignore a specific line
import pickle  # nosec

# For a whole file
# nosec

# Or configure globally in pyproject.toml
```

By incorporating security scanning with Bandit, you add an essential layer of protection against common security vulnerabilities, helping to ensure that your code is not just functional but also secure.

## Finding Dead Code with Vulture

As projects evolve, code can become obsolete but remain in the codebase, creating maintenance burdens and confusion. Vulture is a static analysis tool that identifies unused code – functions, classes, and variables that are defined but never used.

### The Problem of Dead Code

Dead code creates several issues:

1. **Maintenance overhead**: Every line of code needs maintenance
2. **Cognitive load**: Developers need to understand code that serves no purpose
3. **False security**: Tests might pass while dead code goes unchecked
4. **Misleading documentation**: Dead code can appear in documentation generators

### Getting Started with Vulture

Install Vulture in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install vulture
```

Run a basic scan:

```bash
# Scan a specific file
vulture src/my_package/main.py

# Scan your entire codebase
vulture src/
```

### What Vulture Detects

Vulture identifies:

#### 1. Unused Variables

```python
def process_data(data):
    result = []  # Defined but never used
    for item in data:
        processed = transform(item)  # Unused variable
        data.append(item * 2)
    return data
```

#### 2. Unused Functions

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculate the average of a list of numbers."""
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# If this function is never called anywhere, Vulture will flag it
```

#### 3. Unused Classes

```python
class LegacyFormatter:
    """Format data using the legacy method."""
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        
    def format(self):
        return json.dumps(self.data)

# If this class is never instantiated, Vulture will flag it
```

#### 4. Unused Imports

```python
import os
import sys  # If sys is imported but never used
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  # If timedelta is never used
```

### Handling False Positives

Vulture can sometimes flag code that's actually used but in ways it can't detect. Common cases include:

- Classes used through reflection
- Functions called in templates
- Code used in an importable public API

You can create a whitelist file to suppress these reports:

```python
# whitelist.py
# unused_function  # vulture:ignore
```

Run Vulture with the whitelist:

```bash
vulture src/ whitelist.py
```

### Configuration and Integration

Add Vulture to your workflow:

#### Command Line Options

```bash
# Set minimum confidence (default is 60%)
vulture --min-confidence 80 src/

# Exclude test files
vulture src/ --exclude "test_*.py"
```

#### CI Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Find dead code with Vulture
  run: vulture src/ --min-confidence 80
```

### Best Practices for Dead Code Removal

1. **Verify before removing**: Confirm the code is truly unused
2. **Use version control**: Remove code through proper commits with explanations
3. **Update documentation**: Ensure documentation reflects the changes
4. **Run tests**: Confirm nothing breaks when the code is removed
5. **Look for patterns**: Clusters of dead code often indicate larger architectural issues

### When to Run Vulture

- Before major refactoring
- During codebase cleanup
- As part of regular maintenance
- When preparing for a significant release
- When onboarding new team members (helps them focus on what matters)

Regularly checking for and removing dead code keeps your codebase lean and maintainable. It also provides insights into how your application has evolved and may highlight areas where design improvements could be made.

With these additional security and code quality tools in place, your Python development workflow is now even more robust. Let's move on to Part 3, where we'll explore documentation and deployment options.
